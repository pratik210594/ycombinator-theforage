Acceptance Criteria

In the "Shipping Requests" tab of the application, all tasks should now show in the backlog swimlane
All swimlanes should have the class "Swimlane-column"
There should be three swimlanes
When a user drags a card up or down, it reorders the card (frontend only)
When a user drags a card to a new swimlane, it stays in the swimlane
Find a storyboard and a designed version of the page in the resources section below
When a card changes swimlane, it should change color (backlog = grey, in progress = blue, complete = green)
Use the Dragula tool to make this happen
